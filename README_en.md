# INF2120 // Programming II

In the INF2120 course, I deepen my understanding of object-oriented programming in Java, focusing on inheritance, polymorphism, and abstract classes. I learn to work with data structures such as stacks, queues, and binary trees. The course also covers search and sorting techniques, as well as exception handling and event management.
